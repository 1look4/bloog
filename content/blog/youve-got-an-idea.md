You’ve got an idea. You’ve done the market research. You’ve started working on a prototype of your product. But how do you proceed next?

Finding your first set of customers can be a daunting task.

There are a lot of variables involved, like
🔎 Which sector are you operating in - B2B or B2C?
🔎 Are there existing players in the market offering similar products/services?
🔎 How far off are you in your product development phase?
🔎 Do you have any investor network to tap into or are you self-funded?

Answers to these questions will impact the approach you must take in getting your first few clients, but the overall process will remain the same.

When Ashish Agarwal and I started Solutions Infini (now Kaleyra) right out of college, these were the five steps we followed:

1️⃣ Build your Minimum Viable Product.
We built a vanilla version of our offering. It was a basic prototype that could be used by potential customers, but didn’t include all the possible features.
The key here was to not spend a lot of time perfecting the product, because no matter how much we tinkered internally, the true test was going to be actual customer feedback.

2️⃣ Roll out to early adopters.
We identified startups and small enterprises who were either already using similar services or needed them. We pitched our offerings to them at highly competitive rates. The aim was not to generate revenues with high margins from day one, but instead to get honest reviews and testimonials.

3️⃣ Gather feedback.
This was the most crucial part of our roll-out. The experiences our early adopters had defined the direction in which our product development went. We invited criticism wholeheartedly and listened carefully.

4️⃣ Rework on your product.
We went back to our working stations and implemented the changes people expected from our offerings to function better. Sometimes, this meant doing things we had either never thought of or didn’t know how to do. Regardless of the case, we made sure we delivered anyhow. It was important to prove that we cared about our clients.

5️⃣ Go back to your early adopters.
This is where we won our first set of long-lasting customers. We went back to our early adopters with the improvised products that included their recommendations. That’s how we won their trust and confidence. We demonstrated that we were here to stay.

Getting your first 10 clients is never about selling. It is about learning and adapting. Pay attention to pain points, suggestions, and criticism. That’s your golden ticket to success.
